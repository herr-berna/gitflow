# gitflow
Trying to get acquainted with Gitflow.

All my projects until now have been made using only the Master branch.

In collaborative projects, it is very important that you be able to switch between branches, for better version control, debugging, and rewinding
in case something goes wrong.

So that's why I'm studying gitflow!
